**Effective Date:** November 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the BMI AI Calculator Chrome extension ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Information We Collect
- **BMI Calculations**: Height, weight, age, gender, and calculated BMI values stored locally on your device.
- **Chat History**: Messages you send in the chat feature, stored locally for continuity.
- **Theme Preferences**: Dark/light mode settings, stored locally.
- **AI Interactions**: Data sent to Pollination AI for analysis (e.g., BMI details for personalized responses), but only temporarily for processing—no long-term storage by us.

All data is stored locally using Chrome's storage API and never transmitted to our servers or third parties except for AI API calls.

## How We Use Your Information

- Data is processed securely via HTTPS and remains on your device.
- No analytics, tracking, or advertising.

## Third-Party Services
- We use Pollination AI for text generation. Their privacy policy applies to data sent during API calls: https://pollinations.ai/privacy

## Your Rights
- You can clear all stored data via Chrome settings or the extension.
- Uninstall the extension to remove all local data.
